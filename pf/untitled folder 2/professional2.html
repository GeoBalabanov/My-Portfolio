              <h4>Personal Leadership</h4>
              <p>For me to be a leader doesn't mean to be over the whole group, thinking that they will do everything you are saying to them.  A real leader will find the good qualities in everyone and make them feel confident. Personally, I feel really comfortable to be the leader of a group, maybe because the sports have a big role in my life where I was put in a position to work all the time with different people. Other thing is that I like and enjoy listening to people's ideas. It makes me feel good and at the same time I'm receiving a different perspective on the things we are working on. To be a leader is a huge responsibility that we all have to grasp and to be contident in our abilities.</p>
