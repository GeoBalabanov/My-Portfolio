              <h4>Investigative Problem Solving</h4>
              <p>In my opinion, I am a vey creative and curious person. I always want to exchange knowledge with students and teachers and it doesn't really matter what kind of information it will be. The idea of just sitting with someone and brainstorming is fascinating itselt. Through the orienting phase and now in the profile I had the opportunity to solve some problems. For example the pizza project when we had struggles we sat down and just talked how to solve them. It was a real pleasure.</p>              
              <p>I can't wait until the next project when we will have to discuss our work and the potential problems on it.</p>
